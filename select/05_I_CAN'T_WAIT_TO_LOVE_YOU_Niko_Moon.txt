When you take your first breath
You're gon' take mine away
When you take your first step
I won't miss a thing
When those monsters in the closet
Won't let you sleep at night

I'll chase 'em right on out
And make it all Alright
'Cause I'm always gonna be the steady rock you need
You're always gonna be the best part of me

I can't wait to hear your laugh
I can't wait to see your smile
I can't wait to look into your eyes and get lost for a little while

I can't wait to feel your hand when it's holding on to mine
I can't wait for you to say my name
It's gon' get me every time
But out of all the things that I can't wait to do
I can't wait to love you

I hope you take after your momma
Hope you're headstrong like I am
Hope you keep that sense of wonder
When you wonder if you can
'Cause I'm always gonna be the shoulder that you need
You're always gonna be the best part of me

I can't wait to hear your laugh
I can't wait to see your smile
I can't wait to look into your eyes and get lost for a little while
I can't wait to feel your hand when it's holding on to mine

I can't wait for you to say my name
It's gon' get me every time
But out of all the things that I can't wait to do
I can't wait to love you
Like nobody's ever gonna love you
And for you to love me too

I can't wait to see you dance while I'm playin' you a song
I can't wait to hear that pretty voice when you sing along
I can't wait to feel your hand when it's holding on to mine

When you run into my open arms
I'm gon' catch you every time
But out of all the things that I can't wait to do
Out of all the things that I can't wait to do
I can't wait to love you
I can't wait to love you
I can't wait to love you
